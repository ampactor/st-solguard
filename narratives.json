This matters because aggregator dominance concentrates liquidity discovery into a single protocol, creating a structural dependency where new DEXes must integrate Jupiter to reach users. Combined with 9 new DeFi GitHub repos (269 stars, 229 forks) including DEX parsers and arbitrage bots, the surrounding tooling ecosystem is building specifically around Jupiter's transaction flow.",

With $24.8B in total Solana liquid staking TVL, this concentration matters: Jito's MEV-sharing model is winning over Marinade's traditional delegation approach.
